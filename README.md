Descriptive statistics with R

A statistical analysis for the data in iris.csv

We compute the descriptive summary for the forementioned data;
Boxplots contain the descriptive data;
Histograms indicate the distribution;
Normality tests check whether data follow the Gaussian distribution;
Scatterplots seek for correlation between scale variables;
Spearman correlation coefficients are computed.

The iris dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris


some notes:

note that only for the second variable the histogram indicates Gaussian distribution,
confirmed by normality test (all the rest are non-parametric).

note also the strong positive correlation indicated by scatter plots between 3rd and 4th scale variable,
confirmed by Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.9627571 (we are in the non-parametric case).
